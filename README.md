House Price Prediction
📌 Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to predict house prices based on key features such as location, size, number of rooms, and amenities. It utilizes regression techniques to analyze historical data and provide accurate price estimations.

🚀 Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and transforms raw housing data for better model performance.
Feature Selection: Identifies key factors influencing house prices.
Machine Learning Model: Uses regression algorithms to predict house prices.
Evaluation Metrics: Assesses model accuracy using metrics like RMSE and R² score.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy (Data Handling)
Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)
📂 Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset containing house features and their respective prices. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers for improved accuracy.

🔮 Future Improvements
Integrating additional features like neighborhood ratings and market trends.
Implementing advanced models such as Random Forest or XGBoost for better predictions.
Deploying the model as a web application for real-time predictions.
