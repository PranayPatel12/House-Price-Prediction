🏡 House Price Prediction
📌 Project Overview
This project predicts house prices based on various real estate features using machine learning regression models. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to find the most accurate model.

📂 Dataset
The dataset includes multiple features influencing house prices, such as:

🏠 Size of the house
📍 Location
🛏️ Number of bedrooms
🚪 Number of bathrooms
🏗️ Year built
🌆 Neighborhood details
🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📊 Histograms to visualize feature distributions.
🎨 Correlation matrix (heatmap) to analyze feature relationships.
🔍 Scatter plots to observe patterns between features and house prices.
🛠️ Data Preprocessing
✅ Handling missing values
🔤 One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables
🔄 Feature scaling using StandardScaler
✂️ Splitting data into training and validation sets
🚀 Machine Learning Models Used
Implemented multiple regression models for price prediction:

Model	Type
📈 Linear Regression	Baseline model
🔍 Ridge Regression	Regularized model
✂️ Lasso Regression	Feature selection
🔄 ElasticNet Regression	Combined L1 & L2
🌳 Decision Tree Regressor	Non-linear model
🌲 Random Forest Regressor	Ensemble learning
⚡ Gradient Boosting Regressor	Boosted ensemble
📏 Evaluation Metrics
The models were evaluated using:
✔️ Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
✔️ Mean Squared Error (MSE)
✔️ Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
✔️ R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)
✔️ Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) 🆕
